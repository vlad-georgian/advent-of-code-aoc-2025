# Advent of Code 2025 - Typescript

Check the challenges for each day [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025) and copy over you own input data if needed.

Each day is resolved in a separate directory with its own set of tests and input data. For some parts I've included multiple solutions. I tried to keep the usage of helper array loop methods to minimum.

No external or runtime specific imports are used. You can run this in your preferred JS runtime.

> For day 6, it's important that you do NOT trim the lines in the input file, since those extra spaces are important

## Run all

To run each solution for both the sample and provided input data, with metrics:

```
bun start
npm start
```

## Test all

Testing is done using `vitest`.
To check all solutions against the expected answers run

```
bun run test
node test
```

## Run a single day

To run each solution for both the sample and provided input data, with metrics:

```
bun ./day-XX
node ./day-XX
```
